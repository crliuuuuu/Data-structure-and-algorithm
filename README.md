# Data Structure and Algorithm

This repository contains my personal implementation of some fundamental data structures and algorithms using C++. These code files are mainly related to my coursework in Data Structures and Algorithms. Each comes with its own set of reference tests and a test report.

## Contents

The repository covers the following data structures, algorithms, and applications:

- Balance Trees (including AVL Tree and Splay Tree)
- Binary Search Trees
- Vector and Matrix
- Quick Sort 
- Custom Calculator


## Usage

To compile and generate executable files for the code in this repository, navigate to the `src` directory of each project and run `make` in the terminal:

```bash
make
```

You can then run the tests and output the results by executing the run script:

```bash
bash run
```
